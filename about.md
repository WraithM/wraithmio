title: About
---

I write Haskell and Bitcoin code at [Bitnomial](http://bitnomial.com).
Previously, I worked in financial technology consulting, and I co-founded
[PeerTrader](http://peertrader.com), a peer-to-peer lending automating investment platform. I studied
Physics and Mathematics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I
worked on simulations and data analysis for statistical models of complex
phenomena.

My general interests include:

- Bitcoin
- Haskell
- Cryptography and security
- Compilers and programming languages
- Physics
- Mathematics
- Computer graphics
- Rock climbing
- [Emacs](https://github.com/wraithm/emacs.d) / [vim](https://github.com/wraithm/dotfiles/blob/master/vim/.config/nvim/init.vim)
- Human languages (Icelandic, German, and Japanese)
